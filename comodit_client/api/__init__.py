"""
The modules in this package provide classes that describe entities handled
by a ComodIT server (hosts, applications, etc.) as well as tools easing the
handling of these entities. 

All ComodIT entity representations inherit from L{Entity} class which
defines generic operations, in particular creation, update and deletion of
remote entities. Note that a C{Entity} instance is
only the local (i.e. in RAM) representation of a remote instance. Therefore,
altering the state of a local instance does not automatically update remote
object (see L{Entity} class for more details).

Entities are accessed through collections. Each collection is represented by
a class that inherits from L{Collection}. 
Collections may be associated to a particular entity. In this case, the
entity I{owns} the collection and all the entities in the collection.
Collections that are not associated to an entity are called I{root collections}.
These are accessible through an instance of L{Client} which represents a
connection to a ComodIT server. This object is mandatory to any interaction
with a server using this library.

Any entity is reachable starting from one of root collections' entity.
Indeed, ComodIT's data model defines the following structure (each item represents
an entity type or collection, entity representation is given; when an item has a
sub-list, it means each entity of the collection has a collection associated
to it):
  - organizations (see L{Organization})
    - settings (see L{Setting})
    - applications (see L{Application})
      - parameters (see L{Parameter})
      - application files (see L{ApplicationFile})
    - platforms (see L{Platform})
      - parameters (see L{Parameter})
      - settings (see L{Setting})
    - distributions (see L{Distribution})
      - parameters (see L{Parameter})
      - settings (see L{Setting})
    - environments (see L{Environment})
      - settings (see L{Setting})
      - hosts (see L{Host})
        - settings (see L{Setting})
    - groups (see L{organization.Group})
    - purchased applications (see L{PurchasedEntity})
    - purchased distributions (see L{PurchasedEntity})
  - flavors (see L{Flavor})
  - published applications (see L{PublishedApplication})
  - published distributions (see L{PublishedDistribution})

Below script illustrates the usage of defined classes. I{org} is an instance
of L{Organization}, I{host} is an instance of L{Host}.
